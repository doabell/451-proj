## Abstract

Our project utilized (classical and deep) machine learning techniques to analyze and predict housing prices across different counties in the United States, 
with a focus on understanding the most impactful factors.
We were able to carefully identify, select, and merge datasets containing variables related to housing, population, and geo-spatial features.
After constructing several models,
including classical ones via `scikit-learn` and a neural network via `PyTorch`, 
we found that the highest accuracy was achieved by our Random Forest model, 
followed by Gradient Boosting regression;
the neural network performed relative poorly.
These models helped us to identify some of the most important factors of housing prices,
including median income, education attainment, and perhaps surprisingly, longtitude.
The relevant source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/doabell/451-proj).

## Introduction

Housing prices are a crucial aspect of the American economy.
It directly influences various sectors, including the real estate industry,
financial markets, and consumers' purchasing power.
Understanding the determinants of housing prices is therefore essential for potential house buyers,
sellers, renters, and city planners alike.

Thus, this project aims to dissect the relationship between housing prices,
demographic, and socioeconomic indicators across US counties.
We believe our project can inform these relevant sectors,
empower stakeholders,
and pave the way for future work on what actually influences housing prices.

@ho2021predicting studys property price prediction using three machine learning algorithms,
including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM).
Their study finds that RF and GBM provided superior performance over SVM.
In our work, we also incorporate Random Forest models due to their demonstrated efficacy and robustness.
Interpretability is also a key advantage of Random Forest models.

Similarly, @thamarai2020house highlights the importance of utilizing different house-level attributes for price prediction, 
such as the number of bedrooms, age of the house, and proximity to essential facilities like schools and shopping malls. 
We too consider a multitude of housing factors, albeit not directly due to the nature of the US Census, 
and additional socioeconomic features in our analysis. 

In the meantime, @zulkifley2020house emphasizes the importance of data mining in predicting housing prices,
and finds that locational and structural attributes significantly influence such predictions.
As such, our comprehensive set of features include geospatial information, 
including position and land area, in line with this recommendation.

Through our analysis, we aim to contribute to this growing body of research,
and provide further, timely insight into housing price prediction and its influencing factors.

## Value Statement

These are **the users** and **potential beneficiaries** of our project:

- Potential home-buyers and renters, who can make informed decisions when purchasing properties
- Real estate professionals, who can provide better guidance to their clients
- Urban planners and policymakers, who can make more informed decisions regarding zoning,
    land use, and housing policies
- Social workers, who can identify driving factors of inequality in housing and rent prices,
    and prioritize advocating for change in these key areas

These are the **potentially excluded** from benefit **or harmed** by our project:

- Marginalized populations, who may be underrepresented or misrepresented in the data,
    so our model may not accurately reflect their needs and wants
- Residents of certain reguins with inaccurate predictions,
    leading to incorrect conclusions about said region, and / or suboptimal buying / renting decisions

**Personal Reasons**:

I chose this project because I believe a healthy house market is essential for the growth of an economy. It is relevant to everyone, so I'm interested in exploring those possible factors that might contribute to the housing price.

Will our project make the world **a more equitable, just, joyful, peaceful, or sustainable place**?

Under the assumption that our data sources represent different demographics and regions fairly, yes, 
we are confident that with the additional transparency and insight provided by our project, 
the US housing market has the potential to become more equitable, just, and sustainable.

## Materials and Methods

### Data

We utilized two main data sources: Zillow, and the US Census Bureau.
We also collected other explanatory predictors, 
such as land area and geospatial information (longitude & latitude), 
that are also from the Census Bureau.

The US census data is from the 2017-2021 ACS (American Community Survey) 5-Year PUMS (Public Use Microdata Sample), 
accessed through the Census API per [PUMS Documentation](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata/documentation.html). 
This dataset contains information collected by the Census Bureau about individual people or housing units.
We believe this is a representative and authoritative source of information for various demographic and economic factors,
that can influence housing prices and affordability. 

Zillow Housing Data is a collection of datasets from Zillow, a real-estate marketplace company.
It contains features include housing prices, rental prices, city, state, etc.
The relevant data can be accessed [here](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), 
under "ZHVI All Homes (SFR, Condo/Co-op) Time Series, Smoothed, Seasonally Adjusted($), by County".

Lastly, we collected the geospatial data from Census.gov: 
[U.S. Gazetteer Files 2022](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-geodatabases.html).

In our finalized dataset, each row corresponds to a US county as an observation.
Each observation contains the average home value, 
as well as other explanatory factors like median age, income, and education attainment.

Despite our best efforts in collecting comprehensive data, it's important to acknowledge some limitations.
While we were able to gather county-level data from sources like Zillow and the US Census, 
certain house-level factors, like the exact condition of a house, or neighborhood characteristics,
might not be fully represented. 
Moreover, while the US Census publishes widely-used datasets of high quality,
it may still underrepresent certain marginalized communities, 
potentially introducing biases into our findings.

### Selected Variables

A full list of these variable names can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year/2021.html),
under "2021 ACS Detailed Tables Variables".

We were able to select the following variables:

- `B01002_001E`: total median age 
- `B01003_001E`: total population
- `B08134_001E`: travel time to work
- `B15012_001E`: number of Bachelor's degrees
- `B19013_001E`: median household income, inflation-adjusted
- `B19083_001E`: gini index of income inequality
- `B23025_005E`: civilian labor force, unemployed
- `B25001_001E`: total housing units
- `B25002_002E`: occupancy is "occupied"
- `B25018_001E`: median number of rooms
- `B25035_001E`: median year of construction
- `B25040_002E`: houses with heating fuel
- `B25064_001E`: median gross rent
- `B25081_001E`: count of housing units with a mortgage

For potential bias auditing, we also kept these relevant variables:

- `B02001_002E`: White alone
- `B02001_003E`: Black or African American alone
- `B02001_004E`: American Indian and Alaska Native alone
- `B02001_005E`: Asian alone
- `B02001_006E`: Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone
- `B02001_007E`: Some other race alone
- `B02001_008E`: Two or more races
- `B02001_009E`: Two races including Some other race
- `B02001_010E`: Two races excluding Some other race, and three or more races

### Variable importance

Another feature we paid attention to was variable importance.
How did each variable contrinbute to each model's prediction of housing prices?

To ensure consistency between models with different levels of interpretability, 
we chose [permutation importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance.html) as our measurement of feature importance.
Essentially, by permutating a certain feature column, we "mix up" that column's influence on the model predictions, 
so that the resulting difference in performance can be attributed to that feature column.

However, if [multicollinearity](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance_multicollinear.html) or correlation between features are present,
then permutating one column has little effect on model performance,
because the information provided by that feature can be accessed in another, correlating feature.
Therefore, it is also important to plot and inspect a dendrogram for our selected features, to identify any correlations.

## Results

We fitted our selected variables against several popular classical models from the `scikit-learn` package.

These include Linear regression, Linear regression with SGD, Ridge regression, Gradient Boosting regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest models.

We also proceeded to build our own fully-connected neural network using PyTorch.

In order to evaluate those algorithms we used, we implemented two metrics to measure the relative performance:

1. [Coefficient of determination](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html).
    This is the $R^2$ score, or the residual sum of squares divided by the total sum of squares, for a certain model.
    The best possible score is 1.0, and because the model can be arbitrarily worse, scores can be negative, and there is no worst score.
    When the prediction residuals have zero mean, this corresponds to the percent of variance *explained by* the model.
2. Mean Squared Error (MSE).
    This represents the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
    In other words, it quantifies the difference between the estimator (the model's prediction) and the actual value.

Our random forest model achieved a score of `0.9109`, while having a MSE of `1.60781e+09`.

Here is a rundown of our top 5 models' performance, listed in order of decreasing test scores:

1. Random Forest Regression
2. Gradient Boosting Regression
3. Support Vector Regression
4. Ridge Regression
5. Linear Regression

Additionally, here are the top 5 features, ordered by importance (as determined by Random Forest):

1. `B19013_001E`: median household income, inflation-adjusted
2. `INTPTLONG`: longitude (decimal degrees)
3. `B15012_001E`: number of Bachelor’s degrees
4. `B25035_001E`: median year of construction
5. `B19083_001E`: gini index of income inequality

Note that feature importance is not the same as a coefficient in linear regression,
as the relationship may not be linear.
In our Random Forest regressor model, particularly, the corresponding explanation is most likely segmented and discrete.

## Personal Reflection

- *What did you learn from the process of researching, implementing, and communicating about your project?*

Doing this project taught me a bunch of things. For one, I realized how research isn't just about using existing dataset but also about getting creative - like when we had to combine different datasets to get what we needed. I also learned that implementation is about more than just applying algorithms. For example, we developed our own neural network by applying multiple layers. As for communication, I got to see how essential it is to summarize what I have done and communicate it with my peers, which is something I'll definitely carry forward.

- *How do you feel about what you achieved? Did meet your initial goals? Did you exceed them or fall short? In what ways?*

I'm honestly pretty proud of what we achieved. I started off wanting to explore the practical applications of supervised learning algorithms in predicting housing prices, and I feel like we did just that and then some. We didn't just use an existing dataset - we created our own by merging several together, which was a challenge but so rewarding. What's more, I learned how to convert my the dataset to appropriate dataloader. So I'd say we definitely met and even exceeded our goals.

- *In what ways will you carry the experience of working on this project into your next courses, career stages, or personal life?*

This project has given me some solid experience that I'm confident to handle future challenges. The technical skills I've learned and the ability to work collaboratively are valuable to me. I will be sure to carry out that working philosophy in my future academic and career life.
